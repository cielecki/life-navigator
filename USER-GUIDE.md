# Life Navigator User Guide

**Note:** This guide assumes you have already installed Life Navigator and completed the initial setup. If you haven't installed the plugin yet, please follow the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) first.

Life Navigator is an AI-powered personal assistant plugin for Obsidian that helps you with daily planning, reflection, habit building, and life guidance. Unlike generic AI chatbots, Life Navigator knows your personal context and can provide tailored advice based on your goals, preferences, and daily patterns.

## What Makes Life Navigator Different

**Privacy-First Design:** All your data stays on your devices (computer and phone) and syncs through your chosen service (like iCloud). The AI only receives the specific information you choose to share, and no personal data is stored on external servers.

**Contextual Intelligence:** The AI has access to your personal information, daily notes, and patterns, allowing it to provide insights you might not see yourself - like noticing correlations between sleep and mood, or identifying patterns in your behavior.

**Voice-First Interaction:** Designed for natural voice conversations throughout your day. You can quickly log activities, ask for guidance, or reflect on your experiences without typing.

## Core Concepts

### How the AI "Knows" About You

Life Navigator's intelligence comes from three sources:

1. **Your Information Files:** Personal details, goals, preferences, and context you explicitly provide
2. **Daily Notes:** Your ongoing journal entries and activity logs
3. **Current Conversation:** The immediate context of what you're discussing

**Important:** The AI doesn't have persistent memory between sessions. To "teach" it something new, it needs to be saved to your information files or daily notes.

## Getting Started: The Setup Process

You start of with two enabled modes: Navigator and Reflection. After finishing the setup process you should see the navigator mode selected in the chat, press start to set up your own personalised setup using AI.
