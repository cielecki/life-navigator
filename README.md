## The Obsidian Plugin

Life Navigator is built as a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), the privacy-first knowledge management app. We chose Obsidian because it aligns perfectly with our core principles: your notes are just markdown files on your computer, you have complete control over your data, and the vibrant plugin ecosystem allows for deep customization. The Life Navigator plugin transforms Obsidian into a powerful AI-augmented journaling and life management system.

### Key Features

#### 🧠 **Context-Aware AI That Knows You Deeply**

Unlike generic ChatGPT, Life Navigator's AI has access to your personal context, goals, relationships, and history through your linked files. It can provide personalized coaching, insights, and guidance based on your actual life situation, not generic responses.

#### 🎭 **Multiple Customizable AI Personalities (Modes)**

Life Navigator includes 20+ specialized AI modes, each designed for different aspects of life navigation. Switch between them based on your needs:

**Core Modes:**
- **Guide**: Your onboarding companion that helps you discover, configure and master Life Navigator
- **General Assistant**: General-purpose AI helper for any task you'd normally use ChatGPT for
- **Task Manager**: Daily task management hub that helps organize your day and manage priorities

**Specialized Modes:**
- **Detective**, **Brainstorm**: Creative and analytical thinking
- **Start Day**, **Close Day**: Daily routine support
- And many more specialized personalities for specific needs

**Custom Modes:**
- Create your own AI personalities with specific system prompts, voices, and tool access
- Use the built-in **Mode Builder** to develop custom modes with guided assistance
- Extend existing internal modes or build completely new ones from scratch
- Control AI context with file and tool attachments for each mode

#### 🎙️ **Mobile-First Voice Journaling**

Designed for on-the-go use, Life Navigator lets you capture thoughts, update to-do lists, and manage your daily notes using voice input throughout your day. Whether you're commuting, walking, or just want hands-free interaction, simply speak your thoughts and let the AI organize them into your journal and task management system.

#### 🧭 **Full Control Over AI Context**

You have complete control over what information the AI can access. Each mode can be configured with specific context attachments - files and data that are automatically included. No RAGs, no guessing what AI can see - you explicitly choose what context to share through mode configuration.

#### 🔒 **Maximum Data Privacy**

All your personal information is stored locally in your Obsidian vault on your private devices and synced through your own iCloud (or preferred sync service). Unlike other AI tools that store your data in startup databases, Life Navigator keeps everything under your control. The information you choose to share is sent only to trusted API providers (Anthropic and OpenAI) who don't use API data for training ([OpenAI policy](https://community.openai.com/t/data-privacy-with-openai-api/929399), [Anthropic policy](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/7996868-is-my-data-used-for-model-training)) and have strong data retention policies.
