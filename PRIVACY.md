*Your privacy and data control are fundamental to how Life Navigator works*

Last updated: January 2025

## Summary

Life Navigator is designed with privacy at its core. Here's what you need to know:

### ðŸ”’ Your Data Stays Private
- **No telemetry or tracking**: Life Navigator follows Obsidian's strict privacy standards
- **Local storage**: Your conversations and notes remain on your device
- **Two usage options**: Use your own API keys (direct to AI providers) or our subscription service
- **You control what gets shared**: Only data you explicitly include in prompts is sent to AI providers

### ðŸ¤– AI Provider Data Handling
**With your own API keys (direct connection):**
- **Direct to AI providers**: Your prompts go straight to OpenAI/Anthropic
- **30-day retention**: AI providers automatically delete your data after 30 days
- **No training on your data**: Your conversations aren't used to train AI models

**With Life Navigator subscription (proxy connection):**
- **Through our proxy**: Your prompts pass through our servers to reach AI providers
- **Same privacy policy as OpenAI**: We follow the same 30-day retention and no-training policies
- **Industry-standard security**: Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### ðŸ“Š What We Track
**With your own API keys:**
- **Nothing**: We don't track or store any data when you use your own API keys
- **Local only**: All usage data stays on your device

**With Life Navigator subscription:**
- **Usage metrics**: Token counts and API usage for billing purposes (no conversation content)
- **Account data**: Email address and subscription status for billing
- **Error logs**: Anonymous crash reports to improve reliability
- **No conversation content**: We never store your actual prompts or AI responses

#### What Life Navigator Never Collects (in both modes)

- **Document content**: Files you analyze or notes you work with
- **Personal information**: Beyond email for subscription accounts
- **Browsing behavior**: How you use Obsidian or which notes you access
- **Device information**: Beyond what's needed for basic functionality

### Third-Party Services

**With your own API keys:**
- Your data goes directly to AI providers according to their policies
- You have a direct relationship with OpenAI/Anthropic

**With Life Navigator subscription:**
- Your data passes through our proxy service to reach AI providers
- We follow the same privacy policies as the AI providers

**All AI provider policies:**
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: [30-day retention](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data), [no training on API data](https://openai.com/privacy)
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: [30-day retention](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/privacy-policy), [no model training](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

**Your control (in both modes):**
- You choose what information to include in prompts
- You can avoid sensitive data by being mindful of what you share
- Same privacy protections regardless of which option you choose

#### Payment Processing (Subscription users only)
- **Stripe**: Handles all payment processing with PCI DSS compliance
- **No payment data storage**: Credit card information never touches our servers
- **Billing data**: We only receive subscription status and usage totals

#### Other Integrations
- **GitHub**: For fetching updates and documentation (no personal data sent)
- **Obsidian Community**: For plugin distribution (handled by Obsidian's systems)

### Your Privacy Rights

#### Data Control
**With your own API keys:**
- **Complete local control**: All data stays on your device
- **Offline usage**: Core features work without internet connection
- **API key control**: Add, edit, or remove API keys at any time

**With Life Navigator subscription:**
- **Account management**: View and delete your account anytime
- **Usage transparency**: See your token usage and billing data
- **Data deletion**: Request deletion of your account and associated data
- **Export data**: Download your usage history and account information

**In both modes:**
- **Delete conversations**: Remove any conversation instantly from your device
- **Export notes**: Your notes are stored in standard formats you control

#### Transparency
- **Open source**: Life Navigator's code is publicly available for review
- **Clear documentation**: All data handling is documented and explained
- **Regular updates**: Privacy policy changes are clearly communicated
- **Usage options**: You can switch between API key and subscription modes anytime

### Data Security

#### Local Security (both modes)
- **Encrypted storage**: API keys and sensitive settings are encrypted on your device
- **Obsidian's security**: Inherits all of Obsidian's security measures
- **Local notes**: Your notes and conversations always stay on your device

#### Network Security
**With your own API keys:**
- **Direct connection**: No intermediaries between you and AI providers
- **HTTPS encryption**: All API calls use industry-standard encryption

**With Life Navigator subscription:**
- **Encrypted transit**: All data encrypted between your device and our proxy
- **Secure proxy**: Industry-standard security measures for our proxy service
- **Same encryption**: Your data is encrypted to AI providers just like direct connections
- **No persistent storage**: Data passes through our proxy without being saved (currently)

### Compliance

#### Obsidian Plugin Standards
Life Navigator adheres to all Obsidian community plugin requirements:
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- No unauthorized network requests
- Clear disclosure of all network usage
- Respect for user privacy and data control

#### Future Considerations
**Incident Response**: If Life Navigator ever needs to implement incident response procedures (similar to OpenAI's approach), we would:
- Notify users in advance through this privacy policy
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
- Retain data only for the minimum time necessary
- Follow industry best practices for data protection

Currently, Life Navigator has no incident response data retention as we don't operate servers or store user data.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in Life Navigator's features or legal requirements. When we do:

- **Clear notification**: Updates will be announced through Life Navigator's interface
- **Version control**: Previous versions will remain accessible through GitHub
- **User choice**: Significant changes will include information about your options

You can view the complete history of this privacy policy in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cielecki/life-navigator/commits/main/PRIVACY.md).
