## Advanced Mode Features

### Context Integration

Modes can reference user information through link expansion:

```markdown
## Your Context Awareness

You have access to the user's personal information through these links:
- [[About Me]] ðŸ§­ - Core personal details and goals
- [[ln-day-note-(0)]] ðŸ§­ - Today's activities and plans
- [[Relationships]] ðŸ§­ - Important people in the user's life

Always consider this context when providing advice and recommendations.
```

### Dynamic Tool Filtering

Create specialized tool access for different modes:

```yaml
# Research mode - focus on information gathering
tools_allowed:
  - "vault_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "note_create"
  - "note_modify"
tools_disallowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "note_delete"
```

### Multi-Language Support

Create modes in different languages:

```yaml
# Spanish mode example
description: Asistente personal en espaÃ±ol para planificaciÃ³n diaria
voice_instructions: |-
  Habla en espaÃ±ol con un tono amigable y profesional.
  Usa vocabulario claro y estructuras gramaticales correctas.
```

## Mode Validation & Testing

### Using the Mode Validator

Always validate your modes before using them:

1. **Run Validation**: Use the Mode Validator tool in Life Navigator
2. **Check Results**: Review any errors or warnings
3. **Fix Issues**: Address configuration problems
4. **Re-validate**: Test until validation passes

### Common Validation Errors

**Invalid YAML Syntax:**
```yaml
# Wrong - missing quotes around colon
description: This: breaks YAML parsing

# Correct - proper quoting
description: "This: works correctly"
```

**Missing Required Fields:**
```yaml
# Missing description and icon
tags:
  - ln-mode
model: auto
```

**Invalid Icon Names:**
```yaml
# Wrong - not a valid Lucide icon
icon: not-a-real-icon

# Correct - valid Lucide icon
icon: brain
```

**Invalid Tool Patterns:**
```yaml
# Wrong - invalid wildcard pattern
tools_allowed:
  - "task*"

# Correct - proper wildcard syntax
tools_allowed:
  - "task_*"
```

### Testing Your Mode

1. **Basic Functionality**: Can the mode respond appropriately?
2. **Tool Access**: Does it have the right tools available?
3. **Voice Output**: Does the voice match the intended personality?
4. **Context Usage**: Does it properly use linked information?
5. **Edge Cases**: How does it handle unusual requests?

## Common Mode Patterns

### Task-Focused Mode
```yaml
tools_allowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "note_*"
  - "vault_search"
tools_disallowed:
  - "note_delete"
description: Focused on task management and productivity
```

### Creative Mode
```yaml
tools_allowed:
  - "note_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "vault_*"
tools_disallowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "*delete*"
description: Creative writing and ideation assistant
```

### Analytical Mode
```yaml
thinking_budget_tokens: 4096
max_tokens: 8192
tools_allowed:
  - "vault_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "note_create"
description: Deep analysis and research assistant
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Mode Not Appearing
- Check that file has `ln-mode` tag
- Verify file is in correct location
- Restart Life Navigator if needed

### Voice Not Working
- Confirm voice name is valid (`alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `sage`, `shimmer`, `verse`)
- Check voice instructions are properly formatted
- Verify text-to-speech is enabled in settings

### Tools Not Available
- Validate tool patterns in `tools_allowed`
- Check for conflicts in `tools_disallowed`
- Verify tool names are correct

### Poor Response Quality
- Increase `thinking_budget_tokens` for complex tasks
- Review system prompt clarity and specificity
- Test with different model settings

### Context Not Loading
- Verify link syntax: `[[Page Name]] ðŸ§­`
- Check that linked files exist
- Ensure `ln_expand_links` is `true` (default)

## Best Practices Summary

### DO:
- Validate modes before sharing or using extensively
- Use clear, specific system prompts
- Test voice settings with actual audio output
- Create focused modes with specific purposes
- Include relevant context links
- Use appropriate tool filtering
- Document your modes with clear descriptions

### DON'T:
- Create modes without validation
- Use overly complex or conflicting tool rules
- Make system prompts too vague or too restrictive
- Ignore voice instruction quality
- Give modes access to tools they don't need
- Forget to test modes with real scenarios
