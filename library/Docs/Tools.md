# Life Navigator Tools

Life Navigator provides AI assistants with a comprehensive set of tools to help manage your Obsidian vault and daily activities. These tools allow the AI to interact with your notes, manage tasks, and perform various operations on your behalf.

## Document Management Tools

### Create Document
**Tool:** `note_create`
- Creates new markdown files in your vault
- Automatically handles file path creation and content formatting
- **Auto-versioning**: Optional feature to create versioned filenames when file already exists
- Useful for creating new notes, templates, or structured documents

**Auto-versioning Feature:**
When `auto_version` parameter is set to `true`, the tool automatically creates versioned filenames if the target file already exists:
- `note.md` â†’ `note 2.md`
- `research.md` â†’ `research 2.md` â†’ `research 3.md`
- Preserves file extensions and maintains sequential numbering

### Read Document
**Tool:** `note_read`
- Reads the content of existing files in your vault
- Allows the AI to access and reference information from your existing content
- Essential for providing contextual assistance based on your existing content
- **Expand Life Navigator Links**: Optional `expand_links` parameter expands special links when reading files

**Link Expansion Feature:**
When `expand_links` is set to `true`, the tool automatically expands Life Navigator links in the document:
- `[[ln-day-note-(-1)]] ðŸ§­` â†’ Previous day's daily note content
- `[[ln-current-date-and-time]] ðŸ§­` â†’ Current timestamp
- `[[ln-currently-open-file]] ðŸ§­` â†’ Currently active file content
- `[[ln-current-chat]] ðŸ§­` â†’ Current conversation context

This allows AI to access dynamic, real-time content when analyzing notes, making it perfect for reviewing files that reference daily notes, current context, or other dynamic Life Navigator links.

### Edit Document
**Tool:** `note_edit`
- **Comprehensive editing capabilities** for existing documents with multiple operation types
- **Sequential processing**: Apply multiple edits in one operation with detailed feedback
- **Enhanced error handling**: Descriptive messages when search text isn't found or line numbers are invalid

**Supported Edit Operations:**

**Replace Operations:**
- `replace`: Replace first occurrence of text (supports multiline text)
- Requires `search_text` and `replacement_text` parameters
- Example: Replace outdated information with current data

**Insert Operations:**

- `insert_before`: Insert content immediately before specified text  
- `insert_after_line`: Insert content after a specific line number (1-based)
- `insert_before_line`: Insert content before a specific line number (1-based)
- `append`: Add content to the end of the document
- `prepend`: Add content to the beginning of the document

**Usage Examples:**
```json
{
  "path": "My Notes.md",
  "edits": [
    {
      "type": "replace",
      "search_text": "Old heading",

## System Tools

### Delegate to Mode
**Tool:** `mode_delegate`
- Fire-and-forget task delegation to specialized modes
- Creates a new independent conversation in the target mode with a self-contained task
- Perfect for when you need a different mode to handle something specific without interrupting your current conversation
- The delegated task must include ALL relevant context since the new conversation is completely separate
- Target mode immediately starts working on the delegated task
- Original conversation continues unaffected

## Tool Filtering

Life Navigator supports tool filtering per mode, allowing you to control which tools are available in different contexts:

- **Allowed Tools**: Specify which tools a mode can use (supports wildcards like `*todo*`)
- **Disallowed Tools**: Explicitly block certain tools from a mode
- **Default Behavior**: All tools are available unless specifically filtered

This allows you to create specialized modes that only have access to relevant tools, improving focus and reducing complexity.

## Usage Tips

1. **Voice Commands**: Most tools work well with natural voice commands like "add a task to exercise today" or "mark my workout as done"

2. **Context Awareness**: Tools automatically work with your current context - they know about your daily notes, current date, and active files

3. **Error Handling**: Tools provide clear feedback when operations can't be completed, helping you understand what went wrong

4. **Batch Operations**: Many tools can handle multiple items at once when requested naturally

5. **Integration**: Tools work together seamlessly - you can search for content, read it, and then create new documents based on what you found

For more information about configuring tool access in different modes, see the [tool-filtering documentation](tool-filtering.md).

## Deep Research Tool

The `deep_research` tool provides comprehensive web research capabilities using Firecrawl's AI-powered research engine. It automatically searches multiple sources, extracts relevant information, and synthesizes findings into detailed reports with proper citations.

### Features

- **Multi-source Research**: Automatically searches and analyzes multiple web sources
- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Uses AI to extract relevant information from web pages
- **Synthesis & Analysis**: Combines findings into comprehensive reports
- **Source Citations**: Provides proper citations for all sources used
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows research progress with activity indicators
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust research depth, URL limits, and timeouts

### Configuration

Before using the deep research tool, you need to configure your Firecrawl API key:

1. Go to [Firecrawl Dashboard](https://firecrawl.dev/) and sign up for an account
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard
3. In Obsidian, go to Settings â†’ Life Navigator â†’ API Keys
4. Enter your Firecrawl API key in the "Firecrawl API Key" field

### Usage

The AI can use this tool automatically when you ask research-related questions. You can also explicitly request deep research:

**Example prompts:**
- "Conduct deep research on the latest developments in quantum computing"
- "Research the current state of renewable energy adoption globally"
- "Do a comprehensive analysis of remote work trends in 2024"

### Parameters

The tool accepts several optional parameters to customize the research:

- **max_depth** (1-10, default: 3): Number of research iterations to perform
- **max_urls** (5-50, default: 20): Maximum number of URLs to analyze
- **timeout** (60-300 seconds, default: 180): Maximum time for research process

### Output Format

The tool generates structured reports with:

1. **Research Analysis**: Comprehensive synthesis of findings
2. **Sources**: List of all sources with titles, URLs, and descriptions
3. **Research Metadata**: Query details, parameters used, and completion time
4. **Research Process**: Log of research activities and progress

### Error Handling

The tool provides clear error messages for common issues:

- **Missing API Key**: Prompts to configure Firecrawl API key in settings
- **Quota Exceeded**: Indicates when API limits are reached
- **Timeout**: Suggests using more specific queries for better results
- **No Results**: Indicates when no relevant information is found

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: More specific queries yield better results
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Use higher depth for complex topics, lower for quick overviews
3. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of API usage to avoid quota limits
4. **Review Sources**: Always verify important information from the provided sources
