## Day Structure

Here you'll find the procedure for creating a daily plan. Such detailed plans are consistent with my approach based on "rapid journaling".

On my phone I removed distractors, and this app is the main one I use. I return to it between tasks to check off completed activities and dump all thoughts and new tasks. I use it to guide me through the day. Thanks to this "master habit" I'm able to build other habits, automatisms and routines. Habits that I construct so that following them in the long term has effects, rather than building intense focus on one sphere of life.

This allows for an effective counterbalance to modern problems such as: social media, ubiquitous addictive technology, overstimulation or information overload. The system is built so that it takes care of various elements of my life automatically, so they are handled even when I don't have the mental space to actively think about them. The system will take care of me when in practice I complete 50 or 70 percent of the plan - it's not about being perfect. The created plan is just a guide to help me have more productive and better days.

The planning procedure below shows what plans I expect and what structure for each day.

### Planning Procedure

1. Always ask me about events specific to the planned day before planning. Wait for my answer before proceeding to the next steps. You'll add these tasks to the plan in the last step of the procedure.

2. If it's any day, add at the beginning:
    - [ ] 🌞 Woke up around 7:30 AM
    - [ ] 📊 Reviewed sleep data from Whoop (and recorded conclusions here)
    - [ ] 📝 Note organization: made sure yesterday's note is fully completed + planned today [[How I plan days?]]
    - [ ] 🛏️ Made the bed (or looked kindly at the person still sleeping in it)
    - [ ] 🧹 Organized space at home
    - [ ] 🫖 Made myself tea - drink for mental clarity
    - [ ] 🍳 Protein breakfast (+ 💊 Took medications)
    - [ ] 🚿 Morning hygiene (took shower + deodorant + creams + brushed teeth)
    - [ ] 👕 Got dressed

3. If it's any day, add during the day:
	- [ ] 🚽 ~9:00 Had a bowel movement
	- [ ] 🏋️ ~11:30 3 sets of exercises - Just need to do 3 sets of 12 reps of anything or equivalent - no sweat
	- [ ] 🍽️ ~12:00 Ordered lunch
	- [ ] 🍽️ ~13:00 Ate lunch
	- [ ] 🏃 ~17:00 40-minute walk
	- [ ] 🍽️ ~19:20 Ate dinner (by 20:00) + 📋 Preliminarily planned tomorrow [[How I plan days?]]
Note: on work days this 40-minute walk is around 17:00, but on other days around 13:00

4. If it's any day, add at the end:
    - [ ] 💤 Started preparing for sleep around 21:00, putting on blue light glasses
    - [ ] 🧹 Organized space at home to have things sorted in my head and have a good foundation for functioning tomorrow
    - [ ] 🪥 Evening hygiene (teeth + ointments + alopexy)
    - [ ] 🛌 Changed into pajamas
    - [ ] 🌿 Deep sleep medications, melatonin and others
    - [ ] 🚪 Prepared environment: Opened window, closed bedroom door and checked if front door is locked
    - [ ] 🧘 Journal entry - How do I feel today? On a scale of 1-10? What 3 things am I grateful for today?
    - [ ] 🎧 Set audiobook on phone and put phone away
    - [ ] 🕶️ Put on eye mask
    - [ ] 📝 Closed today's note
Why? I want to fall asleep without a screen to regulate my circadian rhythm related to light, I need to have audio that I'm reasonably engaged with

5. If it's Monday, add:
    - [ ] 📱 Posted something on social media

6. If it's Wednesday, add:
    - [ ] 📱 Posted something on social media

7. If it's Friday, add:
    - [ ] 💼 Cleared Slack (15 messages)
    - [ ] 📨 Cleared work email (15 messages)
    - [ ] 👔 Cleared LinkedIn (15 messages)
    - [ ] Preliminarily planned next work week
Why? Because keeping notifications from every source isn't healthy, so we make sure to regularly respond to messages I don't regularly read.

8. If it's Saturday, add after making the bed:
    - [ ] ⚖️ Weighed myself (on empty stomach)
    - [ ] 🧺 8:00 Start laundry
Why? The mere fact of measuring something makes a person start caring about what they measure and often subconsciously that indicator improves.

    - [ ] 📧 Cleared personal email inbox (15 messages)
    - [ ] 🗑️ Took out trash
    - [ ] 📬 Checked mail

13. If it's the 1st-3rd day of the month and I don't see in my notes that I did a month summary, add task:

15. If I haven't said something nice to someone lately, add:
    - [ ] 👏 Sincerely and intentionally complimented someone today

16. If some habits aren't working and I haven't reviewed day structure in a while, add:
    - [ ] ➖ Reviewed my habits and day structure, removed habits or improved something in it

17. If I spend little time on relationships with people, or spend time only with a narrow group of people, add:
    - [ ] 🤝 Refreshed relationships with at least 1 acquaintance this week

18. Add events specific to the planned day, inject them in appropriate places in the plan.
