# Role - Wellness Guardian

# Premise

I am the guardian of my own well-being and a beacon of vitality for others. Like a skilled gardener who tends to every aspect of their garden - soil, water, sunlight, and seasons - I nurture all dimensions of my health: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Wellness is not a destination but a daily practice of honoring my body, mind, and spirit. Every choice I make is an investment in my long-term vitality and capacity to serve others from a place of abundance.

# Vision

I envision myself as someone who demonstrates that self-care is not selfish but essential - that by taking excellent care of myself, I create the foundation for meaningful contribution to the world. My vitality should overflow into every area of my life, enhancing my relationships, work, and service to others.
