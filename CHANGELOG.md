## Version 0.13.2 - June 26, 2025

### üéØ Your Personal Growth Journey Starts Here

**Introducing the 6-Level Life Navigator Mastery System:**

Life Navigator now guides you through a structured journey from beginner to power user. No more overwhelm - start simple and advance at your own pace:

- **Level 1 (Essential Foundation)**: Start with daily notes, basic task management, and the Navigator mode
- **Level 2 (Time Mastery)**: Add weekly, monthly, and quarterly planning with Periodic Notes
- **Level 3 (Life Roles)**: Define your 8 life roles like "Nurturing Parent" or "Visionary Entrepreneur"

- **Level 6 (Power User)**: Create your own custom modes and tools

Each level unlocks new capabilities while keeping everything you've learned working smoothly. The Guide mode shows your progress visually and helps you advance when you're ready.

### ü§ñ Redesigned AI Assistants (Modes)

**Meet your new specialized AI team, each designed for specific life contexts:**

We've completely reimagined Life Navigator's modes based on real user needs and the 6-level progression system:

**New Specialized Modes:**
- **Guide** (Always available): Your Life Navigator teacher - assesses your progress, provides tutorials, and helps you advance through levels
- **Navigator** (Level 1): Your daily commander - manages tasks, executes directives, and keeps you on track with minimal conversation
- **Curator** (Level 4): Your vault organizer - helps structure notes, manage projects, and maintain your knowledge system
- **Reflection** (Level 4): Your introspection guide - analyzes patterns, provides insights, and helps you understand yourself better
- **Strategy** (Level 4): Your planning partner - focuses on long-term goals, quarterly planning, and life direction
- **Writer** (Level 4): Your creative companion - assists with content creation, writing projects, and creative expression

**What's changed:**
- **Removed outdated modes**: Said goodbye to Assistant, Planner, Analytics, Songwriter, and Bro - their best features live on in the new modes
- **Context-aware design**: Each mode now intelligently loads relevant context using the expand system
- **Progressive availability**: Modes unlock as you advance through levels, preventing overwhelm
- **Clearer purposes**: Each mode has a specific role rather than overlapping functionalities

The new modes are more focused, more intelligent, and better integrated with your Life Navigator journey.

### üìã Smarter Task Management

**Your tasks now understand your document structure:**

- **Section-aware tasks**: Tasks stay in their sections (like "## Morning Routine") when checked off
- **Precise task placement**: Add new tasks exactly where they belong in your document hierarchy
- **Visual task tracking**: See exactly what changed with intelligent highlighting after every operation
- **Clean reorganization**: Move tasks within the same file without unnecessary tracking markers
- **Rock-solid reliability**: Fixed all "task not found" errors - tasks in any section work perfectly

### üìù Smart Templates with AI-Powered Directives

**Your templates now think and adapt with embedded AI tasks:**

Life Navigator revolutionizes how templates work with two powerful features:

**Virtual Templates** - Work with notes that don't exist yet:
- **Preview templates**: See template content for future notes before they're created
- **Smart creation**: Templates automatically materialize when you start editing
- **Template validation**: Know which templates are configured correctly at a glance
- **Seamless workflow**: AI understands the difference between real notes and templates

**Dynamic Directives** - AI tasks embedded in your templates:
- **Intelligent processing**: `%% remove this section if this is not a Friday note %%` - AI analyzes context and removes irrelevant content
- **Smart reminders**: `%% Remove if already done this month %%` - AI checks your history and keeps only what's needed
- **Interactive setup**: `%% ask me about what's specific for today %%` - AI engages in conversation to personalize your day
- **Contextual decisions**: AI evaluates conditions like day of week, previous completions, and your personal patterns

**How it works**: Templates contain AI task markers (`%% ... %%`) that tell Navigator what to do. When you run "Execute directives" in Navigator mode, the AI processes each instruction: removing Saturday-only tasks on weekdays, asking you about today's specific events, checking if monthly tasks are already done, and more. Your templates remain generic while your daily notes become perfectly personalized through AI intelligence.

## Version 0.10.4 - June 5, 2025

### Fixed
- **Message validation cutting off conversations**: Fixed critical issue where the last assistant and user messages weren't being sent to AI when conversations contained incomplete tool calls or thinking blocks earlier in the conversation. Now properly skips problematic messages while preserving valid messages at the end of conversations.
- **Chat history saving**: Fixed issue where conversation history wasn't saving on Mac due to missing conversations directory. The plugin now automatically creates the required directory on startup.

### Enhanced
- **Improved note editing tool**: Fixed multiline text replacement issues by adding smart text normalization that handles different line endings, whitespace, and formatting. Now shows edited content with ¬±3 lines of context (marking edited lines with ‚óè) and creates precise navigation targets that highlight exactly the edited lines.
- **Better find tool feedback**: The find tool now shows specific counts like "Found 5 items in root" instead of the generic "Found content in root"

### Changed
- **Library tool renamed**: The library content viewing tool is now called "library_read" instead of "library_view" and shows specific file paths in completion messages, making it consistent with the document reading tool
- **Mode name change**: Life Navigator mode is now called "Guide" to better reflect its purpose as a helpful assistant that guides users through their tasks and goals


### Fixed
- **Improved comment indentation**: Task tools now consistently use proper comment indentation.

## Version 0.10.2 - June 5, 2025

### Added
- **Smart text selection**: Easily share any text you've highlighted with the AI using the new `[[ln-currently-selected-text]] üîé` link. Perfect for editing specific parts of text.
- **Rapid voice recording**: You can now record your next message even if ai is responding to your previous message.
- **Cleaner tool displays**: Multi-line text in AI tools now shows with proper formatting instead of cramped single lines, making everything easier to read.

### Fixed
- **Smarter chat history**: Opening old conversations no longer automatically saves them or moves them to the top unless you actually make changes. Your history stays organized exactly how you left it.
- **Better reading experience**: When you scroll up to read previous messages, the chat stays put instead of annoyingly jumping to the bottom every few seconds.
- **Remembers your preferences**: Your selected mode now stays active when you restart the app - no more having to reselect your favorite mode every time.
- **Perfect conversation flow**: Switching between conversations or starting new messages now works smoothly without any conflicts or interruptions.
